# Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed transactional and customer data to generate business insights for a client (a supermarket chain), with the goal of identifying:
•	Key customer segments

•	Sales performance by product, brand, and customer type

•	Patterns in customer behavior over time

•	Recommendations for marketing and sales strategy
## Tools & Technologies
•	Python (pandas, NumPy)

•	Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, pywaffle

•	Jupyter Notebook / PDF report

•	EDA, feature engineering, segmentation, visualization, and time-series analysis

## Key Insights
## Top Customer Segments:
Budget-conscious Older Families, Young Families, and Retirees are the most valuable, accounting for nearly 40% of total chip sales.
## Top Brands:
Kettle chips dominate both by purchase frequency and volume, followed by Smiths, Doritos, and Pringles.

•	Product Size Preference:
Medium-sized packets (150g–175g) are by far the most popular. Larger packet buyers prefer Smiths, not Kettle.

•	Temporal Trends:
A major spike in transactions occurred between July 2018 and June 2019 — followed by a sharp decline, prompting questions about external influences (e.g. store openings or closures).

## Recommendations
1.	Target Family + Budget Segments
These customers buy in bulk and shop frequently — especially "Older Families + Budget" and "Young Families + Budget".
2.	Promote Top Brands
Focus marketing efforts on Kettle and Doritos, especially for medium packet sizes. Use Smiths for large-packet campaigns.
3.	Investigate Anomalies
The sudden rise and fall in transactions between mid-2018 and mid-2019 needs further investigation.
